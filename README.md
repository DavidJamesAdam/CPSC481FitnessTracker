#What functions we implemented
We have 6 main functions in our prototype:
- Create a new workout
- Create a new exersice
- Log workout info
- Track progress
- Interact with the community
- Settings that would allow the user to change info such as passwords and request help

#Walkthrough
###For creating a workout:
- From workout screen, click "Workouts"
- The list will be empty, click the plus button to create a new workout
- When typing in the name of the workout, "Chest Day" should be entered, description is optional
- Click the checkmark in the bottom left
- Feel free to view category view or list view, but "Chest category" is what is functional
- When selecting from category view, select "Chest" category
- This will bring you to a menu with chest exercises, click the "+" icon on the top right of the benchpress item, which will add an exercise to your list.
- Currently cannot add more exercises, but theoretically, the processes would be the exact same; click the plus icon, select an exercise to add it to the workout
- You can delete an exercise by clicking the red garbage can. There will be a popup with a green check mark and a red x. Click the green check mark to delete, or click out of the popup to cancel. We were just having trouble getting the red x to cancel the delete, something that can be fixed if given more time
- Regardless of deleting or not, click the finish icon in the bottom right corner to finish creating a workout
- You will be redirected to the workout list with the newly created workout
